The pattern appeared multiple times across different stories about his work history. The most striking example was the Kafka architecture story at Electronic Arts. His manager had objected to his proposal because she was concerned it would devalue another team's work, but Andy waited until she went on vacation to have conversations with that team anyway and implement his solution. He framed this as cutting through politics and said if he hadn't done it that way, the change would have gotten mired in technical battles. I can see the desire to drive change in a politically complex organization, but the way he communicated it showed a dismissive attitude toward legitimate organizational and interpersonal concerns. He explicitly told me he doesn't work well in political environments and that he tends to get bored. Combined with his quick job transitions and value judgments about non-tech companies not understanding good engineering, I'm concerned about his professional maturity and ability to navigate the normal complexity of client relationships.",

I asked him to walk me through his prompting sessions, and after a slight hesitation he showed me his thought process.

He had prepared a separate \"OCD branch\" to show me his refactoring work, which showed good workflow hygiene. The only minor detractor was that he's a self-described slow typer.

Our conversation stretched to almost ninety minutes because we got into fascinating territory about AI's impact on software development and the craft of coding. He's clearly smart, technically proficient, and has sophisticated thoughts about where the industry is heading. His capabilities with modern tools, especially LLM-assisted development, genuinely impressed me.\n\nMy concerns aren't about his intelligence or technical ability. They're about professional maturity and consulting readiness. The pattern of criticizing former colleagues, the story about circumventing his manager's authority, and his self-described difficulty with political environments all point to potential friction in client-facing work. When he talked about non-tech companies not understanding good engineering principles, or framed his manager's concerns about team dynamics as obstacles to be worked around rather than legitimate considerations, I saw someone who might struggle with the diplomacy and organizational navigation that consulting demands.\n\nThe question I'm left with is whether these are growth areas that coaching can address, or ingrained patterns that will create problems with clients and teammates. Given our bar for consulting roles and the competitive candidate pool, I'm inclined not to move forward unless we get compelling evidence from references that these concerns are either misread or actively being worked on. If we do proceed, I'd want the next round to explicitly test collaboration skills and probe more deeply into how Andy handles organizational complexity and builds bridges rather than burning them.\n\nI would not advocate strongly for moving Andy forward. The technical skills are there, but the interpersonal concerns are significant enough for a consulting role that I'd need to see strong contradicting evidence to change my assessment.",
